## Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
On the effort I should get A grade, as it took me 1 hour to think of the logic for the code and without finiding any referrences online.
## Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
My solution is definitely a very efficient solution, so based on my solution I would say I earned A grade
## Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.
I struggled in finding the code logic and converting it into C++ code. First I attempted to solve it using two loops but I didnt feel like it was the most effiecient approach, then I remmebered that it could be solved using two pointer so I used the two pointer approach to solve the problem.
